Grip the bar with a double overhand grip or hook grip, about shoulder width apart. Squat down to the bar. Your spine should be in full extension, with a back angle that places your shoulders in front of the bar and your back as vertical as possible\n\n2. Begin by driving through the floor through the front of your heels. As the bar travels upward, maintain a constant back angle. Flare your knees out to the side to help keep them out of the bar's path.\n\n3. After the bar crosses the knees, complete the lift by driving the hips into the bar until your hips and knees are extended."

Take one hand off of the plate and bring it down to the floor to help support your body while you place the weight on your back. Extend your legs back so that you are in a full plank position. Once the plate feels secure on your back, bring your other arm down and place your hands about 36 inches apart. This part can be simplified by having a partner place the weight on your back. This will be your starting position.\n\n2. Lower yourself down until your chest almost touches the floor as you inhale. Next, breathe out and press your upper body back into the starting position.\n\n3. Repeat this pattern for the desired number of repetitions."

Tip: As you execute this motion only the forearms should move. At no time should the upper arms be moving at all. They are to remain perpendicular throughout the movement.\n\n6. Return to starting position slowly.\n\n7. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."

Your arms will be bent at a 90 degree angle.\n\n2. The torso should be straight with the lower back pressed against the pad of the machine and the legs extended pointing towards the floor. This will be your starting position.\n\n3. Now as you breathe out, lift your legs up as you keep them extended. Continue this movement until your legs are roughly parallel to the floor and then hold the contraction for a second. Tip: Do not use any momentum or swinging as you perform this exercise.\n\n4. Slowly go back to the starting position as you breathe in.\n\n5. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."
